TODO:
- Tests for VariableAccessReplacer, or even better: find a general solution for replacing nested expressions
- make really work with @Memoized
- Groovy-Documentation
- Exclude parameters that are just "reentered" into recursive call from copying to local var
- Maybe there is a way to make CPS work (with currying all local vars into closures?)
- The whole void method branch, which makes sense for event loops and alike.
- Add annotation (@NotTailRecursive?) for method calls that are not direct tail-calls
