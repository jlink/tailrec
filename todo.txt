TODO:
- fill in returns for if-then-else, switch, and other non-expressions which do return a value if they are last in a method
- handle recursive calls in some expressions like ternary operator
- refine recursiveness testing: match arg types, check for overloads and overrides.
- Add annotation (@NotTailRecursive?) for method calls that are not direct tail-calls
- Exclude final parameters from copying to local var
- Exclude parameters that are just "reentered" into recursive call from copying to local var
- The whole void method branch, which makes sense for event loops and alike.
