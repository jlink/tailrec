TODO:
- Handle all expressions in ASTNodesReplacer correctly and test them
- refine recursiveness testing: match arg types, check for overloads and overrides.
- Add annotation (@NotTailRecursive?) for method calls that are not direct tail-calls
- Exclude final parameters from copying to local var
- Exclude parameters that are just "reentered" into recursive call from copying to local var
- The whole void method branch, which makes sense for event loops and alike.
