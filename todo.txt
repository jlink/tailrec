TODO:
- switch-case. Problem: continue does not work as expected
- Check if it works with varargs
- Check if it works with default params
- refine recursiveness testing: match arg types, check for overloads and overrides.
- Exclude final parameters from copying to local var
- Exclude parameters that are just "reentered" into recursive call from copying to local var
- The whole void method branch, which makes sense for event loops and alike.
- Add annotation (@NotTailRecursive?) for method calls that are not direct tail-calls
