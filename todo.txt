TODO:
- Extract Non-Void-Branch from TailRecursiveASTTransformation into class of its own
- Groovy-Documentation
- refine recursiveness testing: match arg types, check for overloads and overrides.
- Exclude parameters that are just "reentered" into recursive call from copying to local var
- The whole void method branch, which makes sense for event loops and alike.
- Test all expression replacements in ASTNodesReplacer
- Add annotation (@NotTailRecursive?) for method calls that are not direct tail-calls
