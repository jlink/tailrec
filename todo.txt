TODO:
- Groovy-Documentation
- Exclude parameters that are just "reentered" into recursive call from copying to local var
- Maybe there is a way to make CPS work (with currying all local vars into closures?)
- The whole void method branch, which makes sense for event loops and alike.
- Add annotation (@NotTailRecursive?) for method calls that are not direct tail-calls
